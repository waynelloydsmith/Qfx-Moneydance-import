# this script is started by the Bash script qfxStripper
# its stdout and stderr are redirected to /opt/moneydance/scripts/qfxStripper.log
# so look there are messgaes
# it makes no changes to Scotia , Canadian Tire and CIBC qfx files but will change all the EDT timezones in BMO files to MST
# will most likely work on any qfx with EDT
# associate the gsxStripper bash script with the *.qfx file extension in KDE
# then all you have to do is click on the qfx file displayed in Dolphin an a new file will appear with the word fixed in its name
# just drag and drop the *fixed* file into moneydance.
