I download transactions from 4 Canadian banks at least once a month.
Recently I added bank #4 to the mix.
I started to experience date shifting on the transactions and decided to figure out what was going on.
Below are the results of some testing I did.

Bank #1
qfx file says ... <DTPOSTED>20240620120000.000[-5:EST] uses noon instead of midnight.
using qfx with this bank is fine since a 1 or 2 hour difference in posting time doesn't cause the day to change.
Also found no long descriptions being truncated. Uses both the Description and Memo fields.

Bank #2
qfx file says ... <DTPOSTED>20240622120000 ... uses noon and drops the time zone..
using qfx with this bank is fine since there is no timezone to cause day changes.
Also found no long descriptions being truncated. Uses both the Description and Memo fields.

Bank #3
qfx file says ... <DTPOSTED>20240526230000 ... uses noon and drops the time zone..
using qfx with this bank is fine since there is no timezone to cause day changes.
Also found no long descriptions being truncated. Uses both the Description and Memo fields.

Bank #4
OFX <NAME> is limited to 32 characters. This chops off the long descriptions used on some transactions.
qfx file says ... <DTPOSTED>20240610000000.000[-5:EDT] .. This says the transaction was posted at midnight on June 10 2024.
This causes the dates on the transactions to shift to one day earlier (10pm on June 9 2024 CST).
In Saskatchewan we do not use daylight savings time . We use pure CST.
Part of the year we are either 1 hour behind Toronto or 2 hours behind Toronto. Toronto is EDT.
If the account in moneydance had a property called timezone this would be a better way of tracking what timezone the transactions
in the file represent.
These two issues (Date Shifting and Description Truncation) have caused me to use CSV import with this bank.
Also I want the transactions in moneydance to match what the bank says.

I tried to use the built in csv import but it wants the date to look like yyyy/mm/dd and bank #4 uses yyyymmdd.
(I found this out through trial and error!)
The extension I ended up useing is the "CSV Importer".
There is an excellent help article for the "CSV Importer" at https://github.com/stant/mdcsvimporter2015/releases/tag/helpv16
The banks I use are CIBC, Scotia, Canadian Tire and BMO
Hope this helps some other puzzled soul.
..... update feb 24 2025
looking at <DTPOSTED> in the downloaded .qfx files
CIBC uses noon [-5:EST]
Canadian Tire uses no time zone but fills in the hour
Scotia Bank is using my timezone now [-8:MST] or GMT-8 .. how cool
BMO is using 20250121000000.000[-5:EDT] which is midnight
Most of Ontario is using EST in the winter and EDT in the summer:
so BMO is located some where, where its summer time in February. lucky them.
so of the 4 banks only BMO is causing me a problems.
The day in my system gets shifted one day when I import the qfx.
Its is caused by the midnight thing.
The fix.
two small scripts qfxStipper.py and gfxStripper.sh
put them in /opt/moneydance/scritps
now in kde do the following
run ... kcmshell5 filetypes in a console
then add a group to applications called "Quicken data"
then under "Quicken data" general put *.qfx
then add Applications to applications/Quicken data
under "Application Preference Order" add
/opt/moneydance/scripts/qfxStripper.sh
Leafpad
Mousepad
Kate
Make sure the stripper is at the top of the list.
now open your Downloads folder with Dolphin
click on a qfx file
qfxStipper.py will run
it only looks for [-5:EDT] and changes it to ''
so if there are no [-5:EDT] in the qfx it doesn't change anything
it will create a new qfx file called filename-fixed.qfx
it will also creates a log /opt/moneydance/scripts/qfxStripper.log
now you can drag and drop the filename-fixed.qfx file into moneydance.
Since BMO is the only bank that is causing me a problem you don't need to click on the qfx files from the other banks.
just the BMO ones. so just drag and drop them as usual into moneydance .
if you accidentally click on a qfx from a different bank its no big deal .
you will just end up with a copy of the original .qfx file.
this assumes you have Jython installed on your system.
